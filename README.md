# Invisibilty-Cloak-Third-Deathly-Hallows

*"Death searched for the youngest brother as years passed but never succeeded.
It was only when the third brother reached a great age, he took off the Cloak of Invisibility
and gave it to his son. Greeting Death as an old friend, they departed this life as equals."*

Using Opencv it is now possible to make yourself invisible.
So just grab a uniform color cloth and it's done!

Main Logic :
1. Save background view.
2. Detect the color of image in the video stream using color segmentation method.
3. Eliminate the color and add the background portion to it.
